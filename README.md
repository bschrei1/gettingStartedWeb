# gettingStartedWeb

A web server for getting started with Hapi.js and jQuery. 
This is meant for someone who has a little bit of experience in web development, but has never built an app from
front end interface to backend server.
This takes you through how to serve up a web page from a server, with a basic web stack of html, css, and jQuery
on the frontend with node.js on the backend (Hapi.js is a node framework for making websites and APIs).

<h2> What you will accomplish </h2>
By following this guide you will be able to launch your own server locally and 
be able to serve up html, css, and JavaScript to your browser upon request. 
This can then be used as a foundation for building a site with more content that
could eventually be hosted on the cloud and available to the public!

<h2> First Steps after you've cloned the repo </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Node and npm if you don't have them already </li>
    <li>On your command line run <code>npm install -s</code>to install all of the dependencies locally</li>
    <li>Run <code>npm start</code> to start up the server </li>
    <li>Go to <code>localhost:8000</code> in your browser </li>
    <!--<li></li> -->
    
  </ol>
